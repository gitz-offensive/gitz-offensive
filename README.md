The goal of offensive security is to strengthen the defense mechanisms by discovering and fixing security flaws before malicious attackers can exploit them. Below are some key aspects of Offensive Security:-
Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)
Red teaming
Social engineering
Exploitation of vulnerabilities
Exploiting Web Application Security
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulation


In conclusion, Offensive Security is a crucial aspect of modern cybersecurity. By actively hunting for weaknesses and vulnerabilities, organizations can significantly improve their defenses and better protect their systems from potential attacks.
